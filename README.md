# Study of Sampling Using SIMULINK

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository dedicated to the exploration of sampling using SIMULINK. This project delves into the fundamental concept of sampling, providing a comprehensive understanding of its principles and applications through simulations using SIMULINK.

## Sampling Elaboration
Sampling is a crucial concept in signal processing where continuous signals are converted into discrete signals by selecting specific points at regular intervals. This process is fundamental in various applications, including communication systems, audio processing, and control systems.

### Why Study Sampling?
Understanding sampling is essential for:
- **Anti-aliasing:** Preventing distortion during signal reconstruction.
- **Nyquist Theorem:** Ensuring accurate signal representation.
- **Digital Signal Processing (DSP):** Essential for processing discrete signals.

## SIMULINK Simulations
SIMULINK, a MATLAB-based graphical programming environment, facilitates the simulation of complex systems, making it an ideal tool for studying sampling. This repository provides SIMULINK models and scripts to visualize and analyze the sampling process.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Access the SIMULINK models related to sampling.
3. Run simulations to observe the effects of different sampling parameters.
4. Explore and modify the models to enhance understanding.
